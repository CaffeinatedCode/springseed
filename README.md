# Springseed 3.x

This branch covers Springseed 3.x development. Springseed 3.x will use React and Redux and run in an electron shell, much like the mail client Nylas 1N. We indend to make Springseed the best tool for sharing notes on desktop environments again, since 2.x was a bit of a mess, quite honestly.
